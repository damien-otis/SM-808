Splice Evaluation

> How much time did you spend on the exercise, what parts took longer?

About 22 hours over 2 days, including full documentation. The hardest part was using the Web Audio API features, because I had not previously used them and had to learn it while coding.

> What were the hard parts, what parts did you enjoy most?

The hard parts were dealing with the Web Audio API. I had to learn a bit before I got it working well enough. I enjoyed using this the most becauase it let me tap into the raw audio data, which I plan to use in other projects.

> Data modeling - How did you model the concepts of songs and tracks/patterns, can you explain why?

This is a limited demo, and the concept of songs is not modeled, only tacks/patterns. If I had more time I would create a playlist editor with multiple patterns, and arrangements of patterns. 

> Simplicity vs Flexibility - How flexible is your solution? 

It is both simple and flexible. Volume knob control for each step, BPM is adjustable, it has all of the "extras".

> Can a user define patterns of different lengths? 

Yes.

> Can they play at the same time?

Yes.

> Can the patterns be changed in real time?

Yes.

> Can the velocity be set?

Yes. Right-click on each note to edit the velocity with a knob control.

> None of these features are expected, what is needed for you to add support for these?

They are supported.

> Is your code tested? Why/why not?

No. Not enough time, after 22 hours of coding I'm tired and I need some rest.

> How would you test it (or better)?

I would probably have to develop a new kind of test to deal with web audio to fully test this.

> Try to keep external dependencies to a minimum.

No external dependencies, it was hand-coded from scrach in a weekend.
