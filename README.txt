Splice Evaluation

> How much time did you spend on the exercise, what parts took longer?

	About 22 hours over 2 days. The hardest part was using the Web Audio API features, because I had not previously used them and had to learn it while coding.

> What were the hard parts, what parts did you enjoy most?

	The hard parts were dealing with the Web Audio API. I had to learn a bit before I got it working well enough. I enjoyed using this the most becauase it let me tap into the raw audio data, which I plan to use in other projects.

> Data modeling - How did you model the concepts of songs and tracks/patterns, can you explain why?

	This is a limited demo, and the concept of songs is not modeled, only tacks/patterns. If I had more time I would create a playlist editor and implement creating multiple patterns, and arrangements of patterns in the playlist editor. I will probably continue this code in the future, because why stop here?

> Simplicity vs Flexibility - How flexible is your solution? 

	Very.

> Can a user define patterns of different lengths? 

	Yes.

> Can they play at the same time?

	Yes.

Can the patterns be changed in real time?

	Yes.

Can the velocity be set?

	Yes. Right-click on each step to edit the velocity with a knob control.

>None of these features are expected, what is needed for you to add support for these?

	They are supported.

>Is your code tested? Why/why not?

	No. Not enough time, I'm tired and I need some rest.

> How would you test it (or better)?

	I would probably have to write my own testing framework, as I doubt there are any front-end testing solutions capable of testing a webapp with an audio output.
